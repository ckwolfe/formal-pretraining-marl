2. **Clone this repo** (if you don’t have it yet):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url> formal-pretraining-marl
   cd formal-pretraining-marl
   ```
3. **Open as vault** — In Obsidian: *Open folder as vault* (or *Open another vault* → *Open folder*) and choose the `formal-pretraining-marl` folder. Your notes, links, and graph will load.

From there you can edit `.md` files, use `[[wikilinks]]`, and add papers under `papers/` or notes under `notes/`.

Feel free to push papers (e.g. under `papers/`), new notes, or edits. Keep the structure roughly as is (e.g. `lit_review.md`, `notes/`, `drafts/`) so the vault stays navigable.
